## Mixpanel.NET API Integration for .NET

This project provides basic API integration for using Mixpanel from .NET
applications.  I'm specifically building it with desktop analytics in mind but
it should be useful for a wide range of analytics tracking scenarios.

If you have feature suggestions please open a github issue for them.

Current Features:

* Make basic calls to http://api.mixpanel.com/track and track events

Planned Features:

* Queue (durable?) for events and asyncronous tracking
* Seperate API wrappers for the Mixpanel data query API
